Welcome to my working notes. I write in public about what has my interest. Notes usually start out small (or empty), and grow as I do. The notes are densely linked, unfinished, possibly incorrect, and always ready for improvement. Any note that starts with an asterisk `*`, know that it's an [[Evergreen note]].
