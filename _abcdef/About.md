Heya, I'm pleased you made it to my personal website. It's a quiet street on the Internet where I come to link and think. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative. I come here to learn in public, change my mind, and document and nurture my interests.

### Who I am
I'm a 35-year-old queer Afropean person who is a nerd for the independent internet (which is where humans aren't products). I'm an amateur writer and musician, a home cook, a cinephile, and an urbanite. I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants on the Amsterdam East side.

### What I do
I'm a generalist with thorough experience solving problems where research, design, systems, and strategy meet. Right now I work as a UX Manager in educational technology at [[Leeruniek]]. I have sixteen years of professional experience making digital products. Before this, I lead design at Airtrade for five years. Before that, I ran Studio Zinzy for eight years.
