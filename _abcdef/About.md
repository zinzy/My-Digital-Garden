Hey there, I'm Zinzy Waleson Geene. I'm pleased you made it to my personal website, a quiet street on the Internet. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative. I come here to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.

### Who I am
I'm just this person, you know? Really, I'm a 35-year-old queer Afropean living and working in Amsterdam. First and foremost, I'm a nerd for the independent internet. I also love other things about which you may read on my [[My interests|interests]] page

I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants on the Amsterdam East side. I live with [[Eating disorder|health challenges]] that aren't chronic but persistent, and I'm slowly recovering. We're considering welcoming a [[Dog]] into our home. 

### What I do
At present, I work as a UX Manager in educational technology at [[Leeruniek]]. I have sixteen years of professional experience making digital products. If you're interested in learning more about my work in User Experience, [[Portfolio|check out my portfolio]].
