Hey there, I'm Zinzy, welcome to my personal website. If you're interested in its design and technical details, read my [[Colophon]]. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative. I come here to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.

### Home
I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants on the Amsterdam East side. I live with [[Eating disorder|health challenges]] that aren't chronic but persistent, and I'm slowly recovering.

### Work
At present, I work as a UX Manager in educational technology at Leeruniek. I have sixteen years of experience making digital products. If you're interested in learning more about my work in User Experience, [[Portfolio|check out my portfolio]].
