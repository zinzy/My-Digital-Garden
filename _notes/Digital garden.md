The latest trend in online publishing, a digital garden is a publicly available collection of notes in various stages of refinement, tended to and updated online for everyone to see. It sits snuggly in between a blog and a one-person wiki. 

To me, it’s the culmination of the folder plain text files I’ve been maintaining since around 2005, which exist in my [[Second brain]]. The ones you can see here have been made available to the public. the vast majority of them are kept private for a myriad of reasons.

This space has been around since 2004, in a variety of shapes and under a lot of different names. It has been a blog, a photo blog, a portfolio, a directory, and a one-pager. Its first name was doyoulikemytightsweater.com.

What I like about this technique of organizing media is that it allows a practitioner to write (and therefore perhaps think) in a more molecular way. One oft-highlighted benefit of this is that, as time goes on, nodes might be shared across a number of ideas, making the practitioner aware of connections previously unacknowledged. 

Digital gardens have been [[Design|designed]] as a form of [[Anti-marketing]], where creators are encouraged to [[* Write for yourself first]].

### Manifesto
This is a reminder to myself

- The digital garden is the public part of my working notes.
- It contains thoughts, knowledge, and ideas.
- Its goal is to help me self-express, not showcase.
- Originality is not its goal, understanding is.
- I write because I want to better understand things that have my interest.
- I don't write to impress, flaunt, or flatter.
