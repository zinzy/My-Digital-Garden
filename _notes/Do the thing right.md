"Do the thing right" is the opposite of [[Do the right thing]], which is an important imperative in the world of digital products and [[Design]]. 

Doing the right thing can be something fairly small, like not being racist towards your employee while operating a pizza parlor in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of New York[^1], or it can be big. Such became clear to us all over the course of the past decade, as we saw tech giants rise, rise, rise, and fall, fall, fall. 

If the direct effect it has on human lives weren't so dreadful, I would be mesmerized by the sheer _Black Mirror_-ness of what large social media platforms have managed to create in the world.

	- The "thing" to "do right" can be execution of a correctly-identified, ethically-sound solution. It can also be the method with which we identify said problems.  
	- I've personally reached an interesting threshold on which I wonder: how should I interpret and incorporate the design of people working at companies who don't have users' best interest at heart?
