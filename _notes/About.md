Hey there, I'm Zinzy. I work at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like a good story. Thank you for visiting my website.

I have a great fondness for the creativity, potential, and independence that [[Internet]] gives us. My work aims to bring those values to people solving problems at work. I currently manage design at [[Leeruniek]], where we're taking an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable educational data. Before this I spent five years at Airtrade, a market leader in travel technology. I got my start in UX as a freelancer, running my own design studio for eight years.

### A little history
I was born and raised in the South of the Netherlands, in a complex childhood marked by marching bands, an overabundance of food, and question marks about who, amid everybody else, I am.

I came to [[Utrecht]] to study the letters, and I enjoyed the seemingly endless opportunities that university life provides while running Studio Zinzy. I earned my undergraduate degree in language and literature with a thesis on focalization in the graphic novel adaptation of a Dutch classic.

Before I put my study books on the shelf for good, I spent a year in seminary studying theology. It taught me volumes on church history, how infinitely weird and beautiful the Bible really is, and how strong one's back must be in order to pursue an MDiv as a Black queer person alongside young, fierce,  conservatives. I left after a year and found my way into corporate UX life.

### A little magic
As an afropean queer person, travelling life isn't the most straightforward endeavor. In the past few years I've been involved in founding and leading queer community spaces for people eager to connect and recharge. As a queer facilitator, I enjoy bringing together people from all walks of life. In the Spring of 2018, I founded Queer Salon, a slow-paced gathering in Amsterdam. In 2020, on the cusp of the pandemic, I joined Vine & Fig.

### Life these days
I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, reading, making [[Music]], embroidery, gardening, [[Cooking]], cinema, and biking.
