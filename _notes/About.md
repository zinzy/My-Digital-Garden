Hey there, I'm Zinzy, welcome to my personal website. This page will tell you about who I am in life. If you're interested in learning more about my work in UX, [[Portfolio|check out my portfolio]].

### A little background
I was born and raised in the South of the Netherlands and have been in [[Amsterdam]] since 2015, where I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants.

I have a penchant for reading and writing, and I've been doing the latter since the mid nineties, both online and offline.

I came to [[Utrecht]] to study the letters. Living there, I loved the endless opportunities that academic life provides. I ran an absurdist literary magazine, worked as a research assistant, and I learned to ask critical questions. I also began running Studio Zinzy, a one-person design and development practice. 

I earned my undergraduate degree in [[Dutch Language and Culture]] with a special interest in narratology, comparative literature, intermediality, and sociolinguistics. Before I joined the UX workforce fulltime, I spent a year in seminary studying [[Theology]] to become a minister. It was... an experience. 

Outside of work I moonlight as a queer facilitator. Currently, I'm on the leadership team of [[Vine & Fig]], and I'm the founder and host of [[Queer Salon]].

### My interests

- **[[Humanities]]:** the fire that University lit has never really gone out. I enjoy reading academic research, and very much approach the world through the lens of cultural analysis.
- **[[IndieWeb]]**: I have a great fondness for the creativity, potential, and independence for the Internet. I like tinkering with my own website, and visiting many others.
- **Gathering:** as an amateur facilitator I love learning the art of bringing people together.
- **[[Music]]:** a band geek as a child, I taught myself how to play most wind instruments, as well as a few others. These days, I love writing my own songs and playing the guitar. I'm saving up for a [[Piano]].
- **[[Yoga]]:** I'm a practitioner of various types of [[Yoga]]. I've found they help me tremendously, both physically and emotionally. I'm currently exploring doing teacher training

I also love embroidery, gardening, [[Cooking]], cinema, and biking.
