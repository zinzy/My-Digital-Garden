- Gorgeous shots
- Interesting auditory focalization (specifically the scene with DiMaggio where they seem to exist in a vacuum)
- Interesting use of lighting, particularly flood light style shots that are reminiscent of the later scenes in [[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]], and the constant flood of light celebrities must face
- Photographs that were turned into scenes were boring
- Why would Norma Jeane wear a full face of makeup including the beauty mark when she was "out of character"? That doesn't seem like something she would do
- Shame Jane Russell didn't appear in the [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]] section
- Movie is an hour too long. Are they trying to convey importance with duration?
- I don't know why I expected anything else than a depressing MeToo story
- The first Arthur Miller scene with the weird technicolor background seems entirely unnecessary 
- What does the story want to say? That she was secretly a brilliantly deep actor?
- I wonder when women began calling their love interests "daddy". I can't imagine Marilyn originated this but I also wouldn't put it past her. 
- Whitey putting makeup on Marilyn's face when she's lying down is foreshadowing her death
