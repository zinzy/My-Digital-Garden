Week 52, 2022.

### Week goals
- [ ] I watched or reviewed a Pianote video during each practice, becoming fully familiar and comfortable with the pace and content of the videos
- [ ] I can play a one-handed full octave with thumb tucks without making mistakes, on a metronome
- [ ] I've gotten started with _[Glassworks Opening No. 1](https://musescore.com/user/192873/scores/8338037)_, where a focus rhythm is preferred over correct notes.

> [!Fallback plan] 
> _If I'm too busy or stubborn for a full practice, I will spend 5 minutes on:_
> 
> One-handed progressive scales on a 170 metronome

### Monday, [[2022-12-19]]
- Piano was supposed to arrive today, but it's delayed crying.jpg

### Tuesday, [[2022-12-20]]
- First day on the piano, no structured practice, just play around until you get tired
- Watch and complete exercises of Pianote's "Welcome to the keyboard"
- Take _Glassworks Opening No. 1_ for a short spin if you're up for it
- Log:
	- Got started on _[The Great Escape](https://musescore.com/official_author/scores/6922648)_ and _Glassworks Opening No. 1_
	- Played around with _Don't Stop Believin'_ and _Let it be_
	- I'll need some more understanding of F clef before I can continue with _Glassworks_
	- Had little trouble singing along to _The Great Escape_ later in the evening

## What I learned
- To regain motivation after it has wained, remind yourself of your piano goals, incorporate technique into your practice, meditate afterwards to feel the rebound of a session, check practice categories to see what sparks your interest.
- Piano chord inversion:
	- Playing a chord, but the first note isn't the root. 
	- Inversion is progressive: each next inversion adds the bottom key to the top of the stack
	- Example for C major:
			- Root: C - E - G
			- First inversion: E - G - C
			- Second inversion: G - C - E
	- Throughout inversion cycle, root note is the one with the most space beneath it
- Putting together a practice:
	- Warm-up: simple scale review, dexterity exercise. Whatever gets your fingers moving and helps you arrive at the piano
	- Technique: could be whatever elements from a current song you want to practice (chords? rhythm?)
- Keys:
	- Steps:
		- Half step (from one key to the next)
		- Whole step (skipping a key)
	- Any major scale: W-W-H-W-W-W-H
- The best way for me to refresh my memory on notation isn't by following the Pianote lessons to the letter (although their worksheets provide assistance), but trying to play sheet music of songs I don't know.
- Songs:
	- Philip Glass, _Glassworks: Opening_: first four bars
	- Stevie Wonder, _Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing_, intro, started on chords
	- Patrick Watson, _The Great Escape_, in G and C
	- Radiohead, _Everything in Its Right Place_, free arrangement
	- Refael Mirila, *Running*
