Week 52, 2022.

### Week goals
- [ ] I watched or reviewed a Pianote video during each practice, becoming fully familiar and comfortable with the pace and content of the videos
- [ ] I can play a one-handed full octave with thumb tucks without making mistakes, on a metronome
- [ ] I've gotten started with _[Glassworks Opening No. 1](https://musescore.com/user/192873/scores/8338037)_, where a focus rhythm is preferred over correct notes.

> [!Fallback plan] 
> _If I'm too busy or stubborn for a full practice, I will spend 5 minutes on:_
> 
> Info box.
> No plugin.

## What I learned
- To regain motivation after it has wained, remind yourself of your piano goals, incorporate technique into your practice, meditate afterwards to feel the rebound of a session, check practice categories to see what sparks your interest.
- Piano chord inversion:
	- Playing a chord, but the first note isn't the root. 
	- Inversion is progressive: each next inversion adds the bottom key to the top of the stack
	- Example for C major:
			- Root: C - E - G
			- First inversion: E - G - C
			- Second inversion: G - C - E
	- Throughout inversion cycle, root note is the one with the most space beneath it
- Putting together a practice:
	- Warm-up: simple scale review, dexterity exercise. Whatever gets your fingers moving and helps you arrive at the piano
	- Technique: could be whatever elements from a current song you want to practice (chords? rhythm?)
