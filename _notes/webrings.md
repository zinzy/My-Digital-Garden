excerpt: "One of my favorite things about the independent Internet is a continued interest in webrings."

A webring, one of the many artifacts of the early Internet, is a (sometimes thematic) set of websites that is organized as a chain, with each website pointing to a previous and a next website.

The beauty is the webring is that one can navigate the internet without having to consult a search engine. It's a public form of the cozy web that I quite enjoy. 

I'm pleased that webrings continue to be appreciated in certain corners of the web. 

I'm currently part of these webrings:
