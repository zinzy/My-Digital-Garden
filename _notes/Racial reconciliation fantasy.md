excerpt: "Stories about White people self-actualizing against the backdrop of non-white lives"
---
In a racial reconciliation fantasy, a White person self-actual idea against the backdrop of a non-White (often Black) person's life. The main character, who is a White person, undergoes some form of transformation, in doing so learning that Black people are not so different after all. The Black person doesn't experience much outside of the White person, and their experiences aren't considered relevant, unless it's to propel the change the White person is undergoing. 

Most of my life, I have had to grapple with a lack of [[Representation]] of people like myself. Most of the books I read and films and shows I watched were about White people. If there were non-White people present, the story often evolved into a racial reconciliation fantasy. 

What this taught me, is that my story, my experiences, my reality matters less than others'. Less enough not to get the main story arch. Or that, if I do, it serves to confirm [[stereotypes]] about me. Such stories have made me grateful to even be invited to the party. They also taught me that people who don't relate to me will tell me how my world works, and that I should thank them for it. 

Another effect that such stories have, is that they decrease  our ability to identify racism. As a person who grew up with very limited access to educational materials on racism (either at home or in the classroom), I relied on such films to show me the world. Racial reconciliation fantasies are characterized by a sharp distinction between the main White character, who may "unknowingly" engage in racism, and another, villainous White character (the [foil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(narrative))) who is an overt proponent of racism and white supremacy. The main character is let off the hook by the plot, because they, contrary to the other character, mean well.
