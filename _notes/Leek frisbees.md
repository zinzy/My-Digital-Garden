Silly name for a delicious dish I invented:
- Slice three or four leeks in 1cm- disks
- Arrange flat on baking sheet
- Add olive oil, little salt and pepper
- Put in oven at 200 for 10-15 minutes (until they start to brown)
- Turn oven down to 150
- Ladle with brine made of white wine, pomegranate molasse
- Continue until brown and delicious
- May take hours
