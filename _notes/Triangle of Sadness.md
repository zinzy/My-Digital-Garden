Saw this movie on [[2022-12-19]] at [[Studio K]], expecting something slightly weird about a cruise. It's a good thing I stopped reading after that, because the pirates and the land mine, the resulting ship wreck and ensuing *Survivor* narrative were quite the thrill. I love about this movie the diffuse accents (although I'm sure A. would've pointed out Charlbi Dean Kriek's South-African accent within minutes), reminds me vaguely of that German show _Dark_. Thought I recognized Harris Dickinson, and learned later it's from _Beach Rats_, which I think I must've given up on halfway through. 

I laughed loudly, perhaps a little too loudly, at the shit and vomit scenes, the hallway and bathroom shots of which invoked _[[Titanic]]_ vibes for me. I also laughed loudly every time the woman who could only utter "In den Wolken" did so in the most non sequitur of ways. 

The film had something *Mother!*-esque about it: slices of life tumbling into chaos. 

Some other things:
- Toxic femininity (Yaya and later Abigail)
- The racism scene reminded me of "[[The good men]]"
