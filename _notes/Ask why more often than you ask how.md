A practice you employ at work as much as you do in life, you try to ask "why" more often than you ask "how". You may be inclined, or may be around people who may be inclined to execute available solutions simply because they are there. Call it a form of "busywork". 

In your experience, the slower a process is and more time solutions have to marinate in your mind, the easier it is to forget what problem they solve to begin with, if they do at all.

### The right thing
- Asking "why" helps us [[Do the right thing]]: the effort that guides us to what is most important in the grander scheme of things. E.g. a company may trade the attention economy model facilitating their profit for a subscription model because their algorhythm has a negative effect on mankind.
- Asking "how" helps us [[Do the thing right]]: the effort that guides us to achieve whatever we have defined as important in the context of our own imagination. E.g. a company elects to implement an algorithmically-curated timeline over a reverse-chronological one because user research showed that this was better for their brand appreciation.

### Examples of these traps I've experienced
- Implementing a new process at work because someone read about it on the Internet
- Pushing to solve a minor user problem (usually visual in nature) without understanding the gravity of the problem, or the ways in which it compares to other existing product issues
