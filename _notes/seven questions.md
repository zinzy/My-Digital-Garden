Introduced by Michael Bungay Stanier, the seven questions can help people, particularly those in leadership positions, become better at helping others. 

## Seven questions

1. What’s on your mind? ^a2fe76
2. And what else?
3. What’s the real challenge here for you?
4. What do you want?
5. How can I help?
6. If you’re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?
7. What was most useful for you?

I first learned about this concept while listening to [*Dare to Lead*'s episode on the advice trap](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-michael-bungay-stanier-on-the-advice-trap-and-staying-curious-just-a-little-longer/).
