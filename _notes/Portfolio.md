excerpt: "An overview of my work"
---
I work at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like a good story. I have about sixteen years of experience making digital products.

### My expertise: enterprise UX
Through my years working as a professional designer, I've come to learn that there's one type of thing I like to design best: [[Tools for people at work|digital products people use to solve problems at work]]. I'm fascinated by the complexities and challenges that this field brings.

Currently I manage UX at [[Leeruniek]], where we're taking an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable educational data. My work aims to bring creativity and autonomy to people working in primary education.

### My work experience
- **Leeruniek (2020 - now):** I manage UX at this edtech startup
- **Airtrade (2015 - 2020):** I led design on a large, industry-leading suit of travel booking and management platforms, and built a design and research practice from the ground up
- **Studio Zinzy (2007 - 2015):** I did front-end development and design for companies, organizations, and individuals in journalism, health care, academia, arts, travel, and entertainment

### What I focus on

- **Mentoring:** what I like best about my job is helping other designers flourish in their field. 
- **Design and Research Ops:** I work to properly embed design into the entire product development cycle. In practice, this means advocating for designers, and giving them the right tools to ask and answers the right questions at the right time.
- **Humane technology:** I'm lucky to work at a company that values ethics over profit, and I do my best to contribute solutions that make the world a better place
