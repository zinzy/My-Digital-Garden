title: "Piano"

I got a toy piano at the age four, and I've been a band geek ever since. I taught myself to play most wind, a few percussion, and a number of string instruments. The instrument I longed for most as a child was a piano. In my working class family home, an oft-heard response to my piano pleads were "pianos are for rich people, Zinzy". As a young girl, I promised myself that I'd one day buy myself a piano.

On my 35th birthday I gave myself what I promised. 

Below you'll find rough notes of what I'm learning.

- I'm quite pleased with how I've set up my piano practice, but it makes me nervous. I've fully embraced my learning style (and the hyper focus around which it revolves), yet I know that success on the piano means consistency. I'm running an experiment: I'm surrounding myself with other projects that can spark my hyper focus to accommodate the consistency I need to build.
