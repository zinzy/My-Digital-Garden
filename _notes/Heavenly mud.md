"Hemelse modder" is a rich, creamy chocolate dessert from the Netherlands. My grandma used to make it for Christmas every year, and she sadly passed away before anyone could tease the recipe out of her. I'm making an attempt at making the dish my own.

### First attempt: Christmas Eve
I used a simple [Albert Heijn recipe](https://www.ah.nl/allerhande/recept/R-R1194521/hemelse-modder)  to get started. I'll copy it here for clarity"

#### Ingredients (for 6)
- 150 grams of milk chocolate
- 200 grams of fresh cream
- 30 grams of unsalted butter
- 2 eggs
- 60 grams of white caster sugar

#### Steps
- Melt chocolate au bain-marie:
	- Boil water in sauce pan
	- Break chocolate in small pieces (about 1-2 cm)
	- Add to steel bowl (size of sauce pan)
	- Add 2 tbsp of cream to to bowl
	- Add all 30 grams of butter to the bowl
	- Turn down heat on sauce pan
	- Put steel bowl on top of sauce pan
	- Let everything melt slowly without disturbing
	- Once things are mostly melted, whisk with flat spiral whisk
	- Put bowl to the side
- Separate the 2 eggs
	- Put egg white in one bowl
	- Put egg yoke in another bowl
- Make egg white mixture
	- Add 20 grams of sugar to egg white
	- Whisk egg white and sugar in mixer until stiff peaks form
	- Turn mixture into separate bowl
	- Thoroughly cleam mixer bowl
- Make whipped cream
	- Add cream to a mixer bowl
	- Add 20 grams of sugar to mixer bowl
	- Whisk cream and sugar until stiff
- Make egg yoke mixture
	- Add 20 grams of sugar to egg yokes
	- Whisk until combined
- Combine everything
	- Mix egg yoke mixture into chocolate
	- Carefully fold whipped cream into chocolate 
	- Fold egg white mixture into chocolate
- Leave in fridge to stiffen for min. 1 hour

### First day of Christmas
- Carried out the same steps, with these alterations:
	- Used the prescribed dark chocolate I missed the first time (3/4 dark, 1/4 milk)
	- Left out 10 grams of sugar when mixing with egg yoke to offset sweet flavor I didn't love the first time
	- Used our KitchenAid's mixing bowl to make the whipped cream, and used a separate steel bowl to mix the egg whites with sugar. This meant holding the bowl up to the KitchenAid, which, while more practical ingredient-wise, was not something I'd recommend.
	- Checked if chocolate was at room temperature before mixing in the egg yoke, put it in freezer for a few minutes before doing so
	- Covered the egg white mixture with saran wrap. Noticed it had shifted a little bit once I was ready to mix it in. Don't know if that's because it was in the bowl longer, because I illegally used a different bowl to mix, because it took longer, or something else.
- Dish came out with much better flavor and more vibrant color!
