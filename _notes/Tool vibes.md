excerpt: "A very particular kind of FOMO"
---
Feelings of attachment one may have to a particular tool, physical or digital, in that this tool invokes a longing for a particular way of getting things done. Adjacent to the Portuguese "saudade".

#### Contextualized
I'm aware that the following terms may (somewhat) describe this concept:
- FOMO: fear of missing out on a particular experience, often invoked by social media imagery and other content of people engaging in this experience
- Chain of supply and demand
- Analysis paralysis
- Early adopter complex

#### Cause [[Discomfort of emotions]]
I've found that tool vibes are a very particular longing, one that is caused by the omnipresence of the objects that these tools help us access: our experience of time, our list of tasks, our goals, our vision. 

### Characteristics
- Longing
- Visually heavy
- Problem solving is led by tool availability: I've transformed my own problem by jumping to a tool even if it didn't entirely match, just to experience the relief of having solved my problem

### Images that invoke tool vibes for me
