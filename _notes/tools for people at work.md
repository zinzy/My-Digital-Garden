excerpt: "What I specialize in"
---
As a User Experience professional, I'm specialized in [[Design]]ing tools that people use to solve problems at work. In the industry, we call this "enterprise UX".

Enterprise software often comes with distinct challenges that I find interesting to work with:

- The person using a product is usually not the one buying it (or: employees are forced to use a product their employer deemed best)
- The contexts in which a product is used are specific and different from consumer apps
- Measuring the usability of enterprise software is often an intricate process that requires stamina
- It's difficult to sell enterprise products
- The complex onboarding funnel requires close collaboration between UX and all other disciplines
- The product itself is often highly specialized and complex

I got my start in enterprise UX at Airtrade, where I led design on a suite of travel booking and management products. At [[Leeruniek]], my focus is on educational technology.
