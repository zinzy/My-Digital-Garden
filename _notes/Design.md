This is a pile in my [[Digital garden]], a catcher's mit for various things I've written and learned about design.

To me, design is about making the way people experience life better, more equitable, more sustainable, more fun, more exciting, more informative. Over the years, I've engaged in various types of design, most of them related to digital environments. 

For the past eight years, I've specialized in designing [[Tools for people at work]]. Managing and conducting [[User research]] is my favorite part of my job.
