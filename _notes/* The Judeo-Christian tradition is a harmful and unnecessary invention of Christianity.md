### Fleeting notes
- I thought it was a term invented to refer to a close kinship between Judaism and Christianity that didn't exist between these two and the other Abrahamic religion Islam, but I was wrong: it was created to refer to Jewish converts to Christianity, and later to churches observing a limited amount of Jewish customs to attract Jewish converts.
