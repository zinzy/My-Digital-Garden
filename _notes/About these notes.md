Welcome to my working notes. I [[Think in public]] about [[My interests]]. Notes usually start out small (or empty), and grow as I do. They are densely linked, unfinished, possibly incorrect, and always ready for improvement. There is no public index of all the notes, so instead I invite you to embark on a small [[scavenger hunt]].

### What to explore
- What I'm [[learning]] about
- What I'm [[cooking]]
- [[What I consume]]
- [[Why I have a website]]
- What I think and learn about [[design]]
- My thoughts on the [[Internet]]
