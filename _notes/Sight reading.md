### Clefs
- Question: "Why are there different clefs?"
	- Answer: "The use of different clefs makes it possible to write music for all instruments and voices, regardless of differences inÂ [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessitura "Tessitura"). Using different clefs for different instruments and voices allows each part to be written comfortably on a stave with a minimum of ledger lines."[^1]

#### Treble clef[^2]
- A.k.a. "g clef" because of its placement on G4
```music-abc
"C" C | "D" D | "E" E | "F" F | "G" G | "A" A | "B" B | "C" c |
```

#### Base clef
- A.k.a. "F clef" because of its placement on F3
```music-abc
V:Vc clef=bass
"C" C, | "D" D, | "E" E, | "F" F, | "G" G, | "A" A, | "B" B, | "C" c, |
```

### Landmark notes
```music-abc
"Floating F" f | "Treble C" c | "Treble G" G | "Middle C" C |
```
```music-abc
V:Vc clef=bass
"Bass F" F, | "Bass C" C, | "Ground G" G,, |
```

[^2]: I first thought this was referred to as a [French violin clef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clef#French_violin_clef%E2%80%A0), but that's a defunct clef positioned one line below the G clef.
