### Fleeting notes
- [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) proposed the evergreen note as a stable, durable piece of writing that evolves over time and that can be incorporated into a wider and wider variety of writing and projects. They are the opposite of [[Fleeting notes]] (or "transcient" notes, as Andy calls them).
- I compare the evergreen note to a node in my [[Codex]].
