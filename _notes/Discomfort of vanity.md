I'm using this file to chronicle the emotions I experience having a [[Brutalist web design]] for this website.

- 2022-11-23: I'm looking forward to send [[Why I have a website]] to my friend who should make a website. What if she thinks mine is too ugly?
- 2022-11-23: people have told me they like my website. What if they return and now think it's ugly?
- 2022-11-26: I've reached a huge milestone with the setup of this website, and I felt weird about having an old-fashioned Internet vibe to it. Built 80% of a new design that was more modern-looking and deleted it because I got lazy. 

Update: this short-lived experiment was ended on [[2022-11-27]], when I redesigned this website once again.
