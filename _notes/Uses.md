excerpt: "Things I love and use"
---
I maintain this page as an incomplete overview of the things I love to use. Kind of like [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/), but they haven't requested an interview yet. Before you dive in, please know that I believe (and tell myself in the mirror that) [[* Tools don't matter]]. I don't list all the tools I use (you don't care that I have an iPhone), just the ones that have made a significant impact of which I'm aware.

### Hardware 
- [WH-1000XM4 Wireless Premium Noise Canceling Headphones](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b) have kept me sane working from home in the same room as a high school teacher
- (What brand is that reading light again?)
- [Cubix Round Zip Box Pen Case in black](https://www.jetpens.com/Cubix-Round-Zip-Box-Pen-Case-Black/pd/14514) fits all of the writing and drawing utensils I use on a given day

### Kitchen
- [Le Creuset's silicone spatulas](https://www.lecreuset.com/kitchen-tools/spoons-and-spatulas) facilitate my need to leave nothing behind in any pan, pot, jar, or bowl. The small ones are best.
- [Karasu Knives](https://karasu-knives.com/) is a boutique in Amsterdam run by our "knife guy"

### Wear
- [Nike Sportswear RPM Waistpack](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/t/sportswear-rpm-waistpack-CNTh3z/CQ3817-010): I am one of those people who doesn't like a large day pack, and this fanny pack (the belt of which works for my body) is a great alternative.

### Wellbeing
- [Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask with Nosepiece](https://nidragoods.com/collections/sleep-mask-collection/products/nidra-deep-rest-eye-mask-black): I love being able to have my eyes open while I'm wearing a sleep mask, and this lets me do just that.

### Yoga
- Yogitri ECO Buddhi eye pillow with lavender-scented flax seed, used for savasana
- Yogitri ECO Pratyak bolster
- DoYourYoga half moon meditation pillow
- YogaTimer
- (I have an excellent mat that I'm trying to identify on the [[Internet]])

### Software
- Alfred
- [BetterSleep](https://www.bettersleep.com/): I've been using this app since it was still called Relax Melodies. As someone who [hears things loudly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis), I've been able to significantly improve my experiences in the outside world. I love the fact that I can mix together various sounds.
- Obsidian
- Rectangle

### Miscellaneous
- Tangram set
