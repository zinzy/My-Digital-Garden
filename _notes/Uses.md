excerpt: "Things I love and use"

I maintain this page as an incomplete overview of the things I love to use. Kind of like [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/), but here I don't need an invite. 

Before you dive in, please know that I believe (and tell myself in the mirror that) [[Tools don't matter]]. 

### Hardware 
- [WH-1000XM4 Wireless Premium Noise Canceling Headphones](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b)
- (What brand is that reading light again?)

### Kitchen
- I've inherited Anja's kitchen utensil snobbery and have become a big fan of[ Le Creuset's silicone spatula series](https://www.lecreuset.com/kitchen-tools/spoons-and-spatulas). I wouldn't know how to cook a proper meal without them.

### Wear
- Over the Summer, I got myself a [Nike Sportswear RPM Waistpack](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/t/sportswear-rpm-waistpack-CNTh3z/CQ3817-010). Fanny packs are notoriously sizeist, but luckily this pack's extra belt makes for a create extension, giving me the support I need.

### Wellbeing
- [Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask with Nosepiece](https://nidragoods.com/collections/sleep-mask-collection/products/nidra-deep-rest-eye-mask-black)

### Yoga
- Yogitri ECO Buddhi eye pillow with lavender-scented flax seed, used for savasana
- Yogitri ECO Pratyak bolster
- DoYourYoga half moon meditation pillow
- YogaTimer
- (I have an excellent mat that I'm trying to identify on the Internet)

### Miscellaneous
- Tangram set
