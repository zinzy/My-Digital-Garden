- I have a large, private repository, or Obsidian vault, that carries text files from all areas of my life. They are written in Dutch, because that's the language that represents my truest thinking. There are notes that work in a private and public setting. They're written in English. They are tagged with something like `public`.
- There is a git repository that collects the `public` files.
- My Jekyll website pulls that content into my `_content_` folder
- I don't have to duplicate content to have it serve both a private and a public purpose
