Piano mastery requires consistency, and my brain doesn't like that at all. I've been known to run on musical talent, and combined with the formal musical training I had as a child, I run the risk of [[Coasting]] through my piano journey.



- The best way to start learning piano is by building consistency
- Seven days a week is too much, aim for five
- A practice should be 20-30 minutes
- Practice anatomy:
	- Warm-up
	- Technique  
	- Songs (building repertoire)
	- Improvisation (play creatively, have fun)
	- Review
		- Could be a good fallback plan in case I'm resistant to playing
- Watch lesson on Monday, continue with it throughout the week until you're ready for a new video

### Progression
- Bass clef
- Scales
- Chords
- Scales with bass clef chords
- Scales with treble clef chords
