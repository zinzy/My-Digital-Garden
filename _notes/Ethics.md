### Privacy
[I Don’t Track You Here, But Others Might](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/01/i-dont-track-you-here-but-others-might/ "Permalink to I Don’t Track You Here, But Others Might"). I think what you do on my website is your business, and so I make no effort to track you. Unless you tell me, I have no way of knowing that you're here. I may, on occasion, embed content into a page from a service that does use cookies.  

### Accessibility
Inclusion and diversity are important to me. Because of this, I work to make this website accessible to a wide variety of abilities. I'm a bit of a novice in accessibility, so I hope you'll [[Hello|let me know]] if you come across something that doesn't fit the bill.
