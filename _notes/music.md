I like music: playing it, writing it, and listening to it. 

### What I listen to
For years now I've been using various methods to collect data on the music I play. Most of this data is stored in my [LastFM account](https://www.last.fm/user/zinzywaleson). There was a time between 2008 and 2018 when I had varying ideas on online privacy, which has created a huge gap in my listening history. I continue to regret this.
