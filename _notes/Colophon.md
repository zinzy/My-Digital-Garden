This is a personal website, designed, built, and maintained by [[About|me, Zinzy Waleson Geene]].

### About this space
- This website is casual, unpretentious, and unassuming.
- On here, you'll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. 
- It's organized as a collection of loosely linked, unfinished thoughts.
- I use this website to participate in the IndieWeb, a great community of people who enjoy tinkering on personal websites, as well as independence while they do so.

### Technical details
- This website is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a flat-file content management system I've been using for years. I like my familiarity with the platform, as well as the light-weight nature of flat-file systems.
- I've taken [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) digital garden template for Jekyll as my starting point. I continue to change it on an almost daily basis.
- The font you're looking at is whatever is native to your operating system.
- There are a few [[2022-11-26-notes-on-my-web-mastery|things]] I use to keep things running smoothly. 

### Philosophical considerations 
- I believe in the idea of a singular personal website, containing details on personal and professional matters. 
- I believe in thinking in public, and having it be an act of [[Anti-marketing]]. I work to make this a comfortable space where I feel no pressure to be smart, funny, insightful or anything else that I am not on a permanent basis. 

### To do on this website
