excerpt: "Things I do every now and then"
---
For the past year and a half I've been on a journey to take better care of myself. Part of this journey has been (re)defining what habits mean, to me. With a plethora of books, podcasts, videos, and apps dedicated to helping the audience develop better habits, I felt like I had lost any connection I had to the word. The quantified and often competitive nature of such platforms had me focus on extrinsic (seeing a green checkmark or a visualization of a streak) rather than intrinsic motivation.

Habits I've been cultivating
