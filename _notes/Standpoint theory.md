Standpoint Theory analyzes inter-subjective discourses, arguing that they emerge in and evolve within ones social position. Much like [[Intersectionality]], this theory emphasizes the forming of a standpoint through the existence of a myriad of identities. Rather than considering one type of standpoint to be objective, as was long the case in a White, male-dominated academy, Standpoint Theory sees that the standpoints of people in marginalized positions are crucial for a better understanding of the word.
