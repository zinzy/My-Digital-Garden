Brutalist web design is a style of websites that was inspired by brutalist architecture. It often features content presented in browser-native styling, with few alterations. 

Many websites may employ the style, although it should be noted that a large number of websites that look brutalist were created and designed long before the style emerged. 

David Bryant Copeland proposed the following principles for brutalist web design:

1. Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices
2. Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to clicks
3. Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons
4. The back button works as expected
5. View content by scrolling
6. Decoration when needed and no unrelated content
7. Performance is a feature
