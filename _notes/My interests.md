I love reading, [[cooking]], embroidery, gardening, the cinema, Tanach and Bible study, learning languages, drawing, painting, exploring Amsterdam, biking, and finding quiet time to enjoy the small things in life. I also love:

- **[[Humanities]]:** the fire that University lit has never really gone out. I enjoy reading academic research, and very much approach the world through the lens of cultural analysis.
- **[[IndieWeb]]**: I have a great fondness for the creativity, potential, and independence of the Internet. I like tinkering with my own website, and visiting many others.
- **Gathering:** as an amateur facilitator I love learning the art of bringing people together.
- **[[Music]]:** a band geek as a child, I taught myself how to play most common wind instruments, as well as a few others. These days, I love writing my own songs and playing the guitar, which feels like a fifth limb. I also just bought a [[Piano]].
- **[[Yoga]]:** I'm a practitioner of various types of [[Yoga]]. I've found they help me tremendously, both physically and emotionally. I'm currently exploring doing teacher training.
