This page is part of Derek Sivers' [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) movement. It contains a rough overview of what I'm up to or what's top of mind for me at any given point in time. Traditionally, a now page is updated without maintaining an archive, but I like to see where I've come from.

### Where am I



### What I'm exploring
- History of shaming
- Medieval cussing
