This page is part of Derek Sivers' [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) movement. It contains a rough overview of what I'm up to or what's top of mind for me at any given point in time. Traditionally, a now page is updated without maintaining an archive, but I like to see where I've come from.

### Where I am
- I'm back at work [[Leeruniek]]. After some time spent ruthlessly prioritizing my health, I'm excited to get my hands dirty again. Returning to [[Design]] work feels like a warmth bath.

### Where my focus is
- Enjoying Amsterdam's cultural opportunities by attending some fun events. Check my [[What I consume]] page for details.
- I continue working hard to better manage my health (predominantly my [[Eating disorder]]), which takes a lot of patience, faith, and guts.
- I'm invested in my [[Yoga]] and [[Meditation]] practice
