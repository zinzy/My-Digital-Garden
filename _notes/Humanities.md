The humanities comprises a group of academic fields that study humans, our culture, values, and artifacts with critical and analytical modes of inquiry.

As a student, I was trained in [[Dutch Language and Culture]] and [[Theology]].

### What I love about humanities
- Asking questions about what a particular story means about a particular (sub)culture
- Looking at things that don't traditionally invite serious inquiry (such as [[Silly archives]])
- Asking questions about where one medium begins and the other ends, or what makes a medium what it is
