excerpt: "In a year of big changes, tasty turbulence, not-quite-adult decisions, and lots of boozy dancing, these are the songs that best fit the score."

In many ways, [[2015]] was a transformative year for me.

I like to think the genre dominating 2015's playlist is far from my regular taste in music. After all, most of the songs found a permanent spot in my brain because they were on repeat at the bars I used to frequent. But who am I kidding, I am what I am, and in 2015, I was drunk. 

When I listen to these songs, vivid memories nudge my senses. I smell a girl I had a terrible crush on, feel how awfully tired I was all the time, taste the cigarettes and beer on my breath.

Everything was uncertain and thrilling, and every fiber in me was yearning yearning yearning for whatever was perpetually out of reach. 

Looking back, it was a rough time in my life. At the same time, I'm quite thankful to have such strong memories of the period that can be activated by a simple song, even if it's just for the knowledge that music can achieve such a thing.
