Welcome to my home on the Internet. This website was hand-built by me, and I'm the only one publishing things on it. It contains facts about me and the work I do, but also working notes on some of my ideas, as well as short and longer diary entries. This is an example of a personal website.

### You should make a personal website

#### Where people can find you
If I need to find a person, I google them. I don't use social media, and I usually don't enjoy having to log on to find who I'm looking for. When you own your own website, people don't need to log back on to that no-longer-popular platform to find you.
