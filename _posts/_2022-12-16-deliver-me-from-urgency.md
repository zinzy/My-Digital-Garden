[[2022-11-26-notes-on-my-web-mastery|Last month]] I wrote about a number of technological advances that had found its way to my website, claiming I almost never write about that stuff. Welcome back.

After experiencing a streamlined publishing flow (I write in Obsidian, and whatever is new gets published some time after midnight), I've come up with two reasons why a more manual approach might be valuable after all.

### Clunk, oh the clunk
While I just used the word "streamlined" to refer to my setup, the reality was that it was mildly awkward. I *loved* the continuous deployment part, which detached me from the moment of publication. But running [obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) on iOS and MacOS turns out to be a poor solution for me:
- Just like the me before the rise of cloud computing, I found myself saving desktop progress to continue editing on my phone on the go
- The plugin doesn't (yet?) support merge conflicts fully, which meant I must have recreated my mobile vault two dozen times
- I often found myself having to solve conflicts in hidden files that iOS Obsidian doesn't show

### Too many wires
I've found that the need to optimize any process will increase the likelihood that I develop an urge to optimize more processes. "Well, If I can set up my website to be a non-stop writing experience, how about I tailor my reading strategy while I'm at it?" "If I'm already doing that, why not upgrade the way I've been handling bookmarks?" "Wow, that's all *so* cool and convenient, let me just [get a new subscription to that other service](https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109516100113957282) while I'm at it." Soon, I'll find myself in a web of my own making, eager to [[do the thing right]] rather than asking myself how I can [[do the right thing]]. Trutfully, it was making my head spin.

There's a period in any optimization process where we have to ask ourselves: [is the solution I found too big for the problem I'm solving](https://xkcd.com/1205/)?
