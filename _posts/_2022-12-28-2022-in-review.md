excerpt: "Now that we've reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye — and sometimes in the fabric — of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What makes this year different isn't its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted."

Now that we've reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye — and sometimes in the fabric — of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What makes this year different isn't its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted.

My 2022 was all about a pivot I made, inspired by the health consequences I was (or was eventually going to be) experiencing. 2022 was the backdrop of a recovery journey on which I've been for a while now. The journey took me to the south of Europe, where, gazing out across the hysterically beautiful lavender-colored valleys of the Algarve, I underwent in-patient treatment for an ongoing eating disorder at [Human Concern](https://humanconcern.nl/).

Here are some things I learned there, and here, in 2022.

### I finally found a way to connect with that intuition everybody has been raving about.
I spent my time in the Algarve rigorously slowing and simmering down. Without the usual rush of home life, work, and social engagements distracting me from what's difficult, I learned to listen to what I deeply know to be true. I'm humbled by my new-found ability to care, fully and firstly, about myself and my needs. Entering into that conversation has redeveloped my senses; I've become better at noticing what effect experiences have on me. I'm reminded about all of this each time I practice [[Yin yoga]], in which the space in between poses, the rebound, is of vital importance.

### The design flaw that neurodiversity isn't
Another transformation this year was kickstarted by Elizabeth Filips, a London medical student and YouTuber whose work on productivity has meant wonders for me. All of my life, I've been known to learn quickly, think unusually, and get bored easily. (This is why, as I'm writing this, I'm already playing pretty solid Philip Glass on the piano I got a week ago.)

I was never unaware of what this meant or what it's called, but what I never _got_ was how to work these traits. I always thought I was just bad at consistency, how I was to blame for it, and how I shouldn't stop trying. I've never heard Elizabeth use the word "neurodiversity", but it's refreshing to hear from someone with whom I identify so strongly. Thanks to what I learned from her, I'm spending 2022 eagerly embracing my own learning strategies, while optimizing for passion rather than consistency.

### It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually it isn't.
In my treatment cohort were nine other women, each with a uniquely originated eating disorder. Sharing the most difficult things about our lives gave us a non-verbal language that runs on gut feelings, eyes meeting, and quiet hugs.

I have a renewed appreciation for socially pacing myself, though. In 2022, new people came and went, and with the ones who stayed I shared an understanding: you can't always jumpstart a connection by oversharing, overcommitting, overinvesting. Building relationships takes time, no matter how badly you want to ask a new and exciting person everything about their life.

Lastly, when I do share, I prefer snail mail over quarterly 10-minute voice recording updates over WhatsApp. I spent a portion of 2022 converting the way I keep in touch with people.

### Surround yourself with worthwhile stories
I've given up on the need to read all the time. I have a strong confirmation bias for the notion that I don't read enough, and I'll see people happily devouring books everywhere I turn. Six weeks with no books except a Bible I didn't touch did wonders for me. The guilt I usually feel over this, especially as a literature graduate, is slowly melting away.

Somehow, 2022 helped me draw another conclusion: life is too short to spend it feeding myself with things that shouldn't be crowding my mind. It makes it easy to refuse 



- This is why I won't be seeing _[The Whale](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/opinion/the-whale-film.html)_, and decided that _Them_ wouldn't be for me either.

### Some other things I learned
- **Food is cool, but I must chill:** with an eating disorder that masked itself as a snobbish foodie for over a decade, I am wise to be careful when engaging with kitchen projects. After coming back from Portugal, a major shift has been the time I spend in the kitchen. Before I left, I would easily do seven- or ten-hour stints on weekdays[^1]. These days, I try to limit myself to an hour, with relative success.
- **Dogs aren't so bad after all:** if you know me in person, one thing you will understand is that, historically, I'm known to hate dogs. Bill Murray once noted that he's "suspicious of people who don't like dogs", and I've always proudly countered that with "don't trust people who are suspicious of people who don't like dogs". That being said, 2022 gave me the soft eyes required to decide with Anja that we will be making an effort to welcome a corgi into our home.

### 8. At heart, I'm a researcher

One of the main aspects of my professional career has been knowledge work, and while I love nursing the skillset required for that work, I did discover this year that Product Management is not the path for me.


### 9. Eventually we become our own perpetrators. It's a [[health]] hazard.
