- I encounter alt text more often
- Using speechify 
- People writing it in profiles, outside of alt text
- Giving words to the unspoken
- We don't have alt text culture yet, this is just my narrow perspective
- im not interested here in what it means for the people who need it (see NYT)
- What does it mean for people who can see the images?
	- How do you interpret your photo?
	- How unimaginative are you in writing?
	- alt text says more about why you choose to add an image that's both decorative and suggestive
