- The week was fairly quiet: I'm still having trouble getting enough rest, which leads to headaches and dizzy spells, but with enough breaks, naps, and beauty sleep I seem to be on a path to feeling better.
- I'm continuing to settle back into work, and I love working on my own design assignment. I can see how much I missed the tangible, practical design work, as well as design collaboration.
- Don't tell A, but I indulged in a new Filofax setup for 2023. I got my hands on both their [Week on Two Pages Diary](https://uk.filofax.com/collections/a5-refills-for-organisers-and-clipbook/products/minimal-week-to-view-diary-a5-2023), and their [One Day on a Page Diary](https://uk.filofax.com/products/one-day-on-a-page-diary-with-appointments-a5-2023?_pos=1&_sid=315704f6e&_ss=r), to give myself ample space to organize. I'm quite exicted to try the week pages, which have a monthly planner section as well.
- I watched [Girl In The Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Floyd#Death_of_Suzanne_Sevakis), and all I can say is: I have quite the stomach for gruesome stories, but this shook me.
- I also watched [15 Minutes of Shame](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188206/) and I loved it, particularly the connection they made to medieval punishment. It made me think back to my time as a student, getting acquainted with medieval literature for the first time.
- I had the 👏🏽  best 👏🏽  Chinese 👏🏽  food of my life, at [Hoi Tin](https://www.hoitin.nl/).
