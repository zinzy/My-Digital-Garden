Twelve things I learned during my 35th year on Earth. 

### Blind faith in health care is a privilege
There's a [[Eating disorder|place in the South of Portugal]] where, for a number of weeks in 2022, I felt 100% safe, inspired, at home, calm, hopeful, and daring. While I was undergoing voluntary in-patient treatment, being in that clinic, surrounded by those clients and therapists, that environment, those scents, flavors, and textures, it felt like the most natural, obvious thing in the world I frequently found myself imagining that what I was feeling must be what being in the womb is like. Coming back to the Netherlands, I see such stellar healthcare isn't available for everyone. 

### Found a way to connect with that [[Deep knowing|intuition]] everybody's been raving about.


- I'm a fan of the [[Yin yoga]] concept of the rebound

### The design flaw that neurodiversity isn't
- Playing the [[piano]] is akin to meditation for me.
- Give me a box of tangram and for the next few hours you won't even know I'm here.

### It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually not. 
- For a large part, 2022 has been the backdrop of my recovery journey. I went for voluntary in-patient treatment in October, together with nine other individuals, each with their own struggles and hopes. It was truly marvelous to connect with them so deeply, to the point where we barely need a word to understand that the other might not be doing well. 
- I prefer snail mail over digital communication. The finest snail mail is made up of free postcards collected from restroom card displays, museums, and supermarkets.
- The easiest way to make a friend is by pacing yourself. 

### Stories with which I surround myself
- I continue reading about a novel, film or television series after I've finished it, to extend my stay in the story world.
- Life is calm when I don't have to read. I dreaded having to spend [[Eating disorder|six weeks]] without an assortment of bibles, and I didn't miss a single one of them.

### Food is cool, but I must chill
- [[Leek frisbees]] are an excellent treatment of leek.
- When I'm not spending [[Eating disorder|seven hours to prepare a weeknight dish]], it turns out there is so much more to life

### Dogs aren't so bad after all


### At heart, I'm a researcher
One of the main aspects of my professional career has been knowledge work, and while I love nursing the skillset required for that work, I did discover this year that Product Management is not the path for me.

### Eventually we become our own perpetrators. It's a [[health]] hazard.
