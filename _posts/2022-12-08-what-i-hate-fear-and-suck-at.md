A year ago, as part of my [[Eating disorder|recovery journey]], my therapist asked me:

> What are your core values? Like, what are your deepest needs and desires?

She reminded me last week that, instead of pausing to think of a response, I laughed straight in her face. 

Historically, I've had trouble identifying what I want, need, desire, hope for, and dream of.

In-patient treatment has helped train that muscle, though. My first vision board there consisted of kind interactions with strangers in coffee houses, while other clients were planning to pursue a Master's or travel the world. On the flight back I made my first-ever attempt at a [[Bucket list]]. 

Treatment taught me a hack that's now helping me figure out what I hope 2023 will look like. Instead of identifying what I *do* hope, want, and yearn for, I look at what I *don't*. What I hate can tell me something about what I fear. What I fear can, in turn, lead me to what I desire. Knowing what I suck at can help me identify challenges I might encounter as I move towards those desires. 

As the year comes to a close, and as I figure out once again, but now from scratch, [[How I Life OS]], I'm asking myself:

- What do I hate?
- What do I fear?
- What do I suck at?

Rather than seeing my weak points as things I must improve in order to be healthy and happy, I try to figure out how I can use these characteristics to my benefit. I'm looking forward to optimizing *for* them, so I can have a realistic outlook as I learn and thrive.
