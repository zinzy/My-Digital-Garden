Now that we've reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye — and sometimes the fabric — of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What makes this year different isn't its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted.

My 2022 was all about a pivot I made, inspired by the health consequences I was (or eventually would be) experiencing. 2022 was the backdrop of a recovery journey on which I've been for a while now. The journey took me to the south of Europe, where, gazing out across the hysterically beautiful lavender-colored valleys of the Algarve, I underwent in-patient treatment for an ongoing eating disorder at Human Concern. Here are twelve things I learned there, and here, in 2022.

### 1. I finally found a way to connect with that intuition everybody has been raving about.
I spent my time in the Algarve rigorously slowing and simmering down. Without the usual rush of home life, work, and social engagements distracting me from what's difficult, I learned to listen to what I deeply know to be true. I'm humbled by my new-found ability to care, fully and firstly, about myself and my needs. Entering into that conversation has redeveloped my senses. I've become better at noticing what effect experiences have on me. I'm reminded about all of this each time I practice [[Yin yoga]], in which the space in between poses, the rebound, is of vital importance.

### 2. It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually it isn't.
In my treatment cohort were nine other women, each with a unique genesis of their eating disorder. Sharing the most difficult things about our lives gave us a non-verbal language that runs on gut feelings, eyes meeting, and quiet hugs. I have a renewed appreciation for socially pacing myself, though. In 2022, new people came and went, and with the ones who stayed I shared an understanding: you can't always jumpstart a connection by oversharing, overcommitting, overinvesting. When I do share, I prefer snail mail over monthly 10-minute voice recording updates over WhatsApp.

### 3. Blind faith in health care is a privilege
In the Algarve, the care I was receiving felt so natural, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. I imagine it was closest I will ever come to the feeling of being in the womb. Looking back, I'm stunned by the experience I was granted.

### 4. The design flaw that neurodiversity isn't
Another transformation this year came in the form of Elizabeth Filips, a London medical student and YouTuber whose work on productivity has meant wonders for me. All of my life, I've been known to learn quickly, think unusually, and get bored easily. (This is why, as I'm writing this, I'm already playing pretty solid Philip Glass on the piano I got five days ago.) I was never unaware of what this meant or what it's called, but what I never _got_ was how to work these traits. I always thought I was just bad at consistency, how I was to blame for it, and how I shouldn't stop trying. I've never heard Elizabeth use the word "neurodiversity", but it's refreshing to hear from someone with whom I identify so strongly. Thanks to what I learned from her, I'm spending 2022 eagerly embracing my own learning strategies, while optimizing for passion rather than consistency.

### 5. Surround yourself with worthwhile stories
It seems that I felt much more comfortable about

- I continue reading about a novel, film or television series after I've finished it, to extend my stay in the story world.

- Life is calm when I don't have to read. I dreaded having to spend [[Eating disorder|six weeks]] without an assortment of bibles, and I didn't miss a single one of them.

  

### 6. Food is cool, but I must chill
- [[Leek frisbees]] are an excellent treatment of leek.
- When I'm not spending [[Eating disorder|seven hours to prepare a weeknight dish]], it turns out there is so much more to life

### 7. Dogs aren't so bad after all
  

### 8. At heart, I'm a researcher

One of the main aspects of my professional career has been knowledge work, and while I love nursing the skillset required for that work, I did discover this year that Product Management is not the path for me.


### 9. Eventually we become our own perpetrators. It's a [[health]] hazard.
